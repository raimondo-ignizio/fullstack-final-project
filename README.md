# Libramente

The final Full Stack Developer project on Start2Impact.

# Description

Libramente is a site that lets the users take track of the books they want to read.

# Usage

To begin using the site's functionalities the user must register an account first.
After the login process is completed, the user can add books to his list through the "Add a book" form, then visualize them on a table and eventually sign them as read.
The user can also visualize only the books that has not already finished reading.
